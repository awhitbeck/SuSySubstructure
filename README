# Main analyzer  #
##################

# The main analyzer is written to run over 
# the LPC SUSY PAT-tuples:
# https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/LPCSusyDataset

# to run locally 

cmsRun SuSySubstructureAnalysis.py < options >

# note options can be found with --help
# i.e. python SuSySubstructureAnalysis.py --help

# Example:
# running over T1tttt sample 

cmsRun SuSySubstructureAnalysis.py inputFilesConfig=T1tttt_mG1000_mLSP200_LPCSUSYPAT outputFile=T1tttt_mG1000_mLSP200_LPCSUSYPAT applySUSYfilter=True mLSP=200 mGo=1000

# root files with flat tree will be saved

# to run with condor:

# use scripts in test/condorSub directory.  There 
# is also a script to parallelize large samples, test/condorSub/generateSubmission.sh
# the user should be careful to specify the options in test/condorSub/run.tpl 
# to be used for the main analyzer, see description above and to specify 
# the total number of events in the sample as well as the number of event 
# to process per job

bash generateSubmission.sh

# to run with CRAB

# coming soon...
